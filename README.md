### Abstract

Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) is a powerful, nonparametric tool developed based on the Bayesian theory and the Statistical learning theory. Choosing the right Mean Functions, Kernel Functions as well as the Likelihood Functions and the Inference Methods have been critical to the performance of the model. However, these works are often hard and require much expertise & experience.

In this paper, we ﬁrst give an introduction on the overall process of GPR. Subsequently, we give a precise explanation on some of the recent works which emphasize on the choice of the Kernel Function. In addition, we implement suﬃcient number of experiments to systematically analyze the performance of GPR with diﬀerent Likelihood Functions and the Inference Methods. Our experiments are conducted on two interesting datasets.

We seek to provide an comprehensive practical overview in the ﬁeld of Gaussian Process Regression.
