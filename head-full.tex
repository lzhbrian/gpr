Gaussian Process Regression is a powerful, non-parametric tool developed based on the Bayesian theory and the Statistical learning theory. Choosing the right \emph{Mean Functions}, \emph{Kernel Functions} as well as the \emph{Likelihood Functions} and the \emph{Inference Methods} have been critical to the performance of the model. However, these works are often hard and timeconsuming.

In this paper, we first give an introduction on the overall process of the Gaussian Process Regression. 
We also summarize some of the recent works which emphasize on the automatic construction of the \emph{Kernel Function}.
In addition, we implement sufficient number of experiments to systematically analyze the performance of different \emph{Mean Functions}, \emph{Likelihood Functions} and the \emph{Inference Methods}. Our experiments are conducted on two interesting datasets. We seek to provide an comprehensive practical overview on the field of Gaussian Process Regression.

% Section: Conclusion
\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we discuss about the Gaussian Process Regression.
% We comprehensively introduce the concept of Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm and conduct an experiment to verify its correctness. We also make some analysis about how accepting rate would interfere the sampling result.

We systematically compare three methods of partition function estimation which are crucial works in training a Restricted Bolztmann Machine or a Deep Belief Network. 

As future work, we would like to join more methods to the comparison and if could, propose some improvement to the algorithms available.
