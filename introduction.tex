\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Machine learning has been a heated research topic these days. With this amazing tool, we are now capable of predicting the price of the stock price based on history, doing the classifying by just inputing the pixels of images.

Supervised learning is one of the most important sections for machine learning. And Regression is possibly the core of supervised learning.

In Gaussian Process Regression, we take advantage of the flexibility and simplicity of Gaussian Process and implement it into a regression problem. 


The structure of this pape is as follows: 
In section \ref{sec:intro} we provide an overview of Gaussian Process Regression. 
Section \ref{sec:autokernel} describes some of the recent works on the methods for auto-construction of the kernels.
In section \ref{sec:experiment} we conduct two experiments.
Conclusions are drawn in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
