\para{Inference Methods}
Some popular works on inference methods include
MCMC\cite{gamerman1997sampling},
Expectation Propagation\cite{minka2001expectation},
Variational Bayes\cite{palmer2006variational,nickisch2009convex}
and Laplace Approximation\cite{tierney1986accurate},
etc.
Due to the limited time and space, we won't go very deep into these inference methods.
