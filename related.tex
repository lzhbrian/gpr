\para{Gaussian Process Regression}
Rasmussen\cite{rasmussen2006gaussian} and Williams\cite{williams1998prediction} have a wonderful fundamental work on the introduction of Gaussian Process Regression.



\para{Kernel Choice}
Duvenaud et.al introduce a GP model of functions which are additive\cite{duvenaud2011additive}.
Along with Lloyd et.al, they introduce a way to automatic construct some desired kernels to better fit the dataset\cite{duvenaud2013structure,duvenaud2014automatic}.
They also figure out an auto way to produce the Natural-Language description of a data structure\cite{lloyd2014automatic}.
In this paper, we will give a precise introduction on the above work.

\para{Inference Methods}
Some popular works on inference methods include
MCMC\cite{gamerman1997sampling},
Expectation Propagation\cite{minka2001expectation},
Variational Bayes\cite{palmer2006variational,nickisch2009convex},
Leave-One-Out\cite{fukunaga1989leave},
and Laplace Approximation\cite{tierney1986accurate},
etc.
Due to the limited time and space, we won't go very deep into these inference methods.\\ \\
